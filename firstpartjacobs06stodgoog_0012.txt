The participles occurring in the Reader may generally
be found in the vocabulary3 but in some cases, and especial-
ly when regularly formed from verbs of the first conjugation,
they have been intentionally omitted, since their formation
is aa easy as that of any other part of the verb. The defi-

nitione of the participles have, in general, been omitted, ’

except in cases in which their meaning cannot be easily
inserted from that of their verbs. The formation of the
passive voice is seldom given, since its omission can ocea-
sion no embarrassment to one who is moderately acquainted
with the paradigma of the Grammar. On the other hand,
the oblique casea of noune and pronouna, and the perfect
tenses of verbs, when peculial-ly irregular, are inserted in
their alphabetical order, with a reference to the words from
which they are derived. The derivation of worda, except
when they immediately follow their primitives, is, in general,
given in the vocabulary. The quantity of the penult, in
all words of more than two syllable3‚ when not determined
by general rules, is marked throughout this volume, as well
as in the Grammar to which it refers, in the hope that early
habits of incorrect pronunciation may, by this means, he in
a great measure prevented.

The references, at the foot of the pages, relate to the
sections and subdivisions of Andrews and Stoddard’s Latin
Grammar.
