found in elementary works are in a great degree lost, in
consequence of their connection with the grammar not
being sufficiently evident. This evil cannot, indeed, be
avoided, while the grammar with which the student is
furnished does not fully explain the idioms of the language.
While referring to the Grammar, the editor has endeavored
to keep in view the fundamental principle of education, that
the only efficient help which the student can receive, is that
which leads him ultimately to exercise his own faculties.
While, therefore, the less prominent difficulties are usually
explained upon their first occurrence, the student is aster-
wards, in most cases, left to perceive the additional instances
in which the same principle is to be applied. In cases of
greater difficulty, however, reference is repeatedly made to
the same principle; and this is more particularly the case in
regard to idioms which are either imperfectly exhibited, or
altogether overlooked, in the grammars heretofore in com·
mon use. It is not improbable that, to some teachers, the
references may appear too numerous, while, to others, the
unexplained difficulties may still seem too formidable sor a
majority of those sor whose use the work is intended. No
plan of assistance can be equally well adapted to all students;

but the hope is entertained, that a system which sends them
back to their Grammar for information,‘ will be liable to as

few objections and abuses as any which can be devised.
The preparation of the vocabulary has occasioned more
labor than any other part of the Reader3 and, in its present
form, I trust that it will be found better adapted to its pur-
pose than such vocabularies usually are. ‘The meanings
assigned to the words have been selected with careful
reference to all the places where those words occur in the,
Reader. In this part, more than in any other, the former .
editions of this work were defective, and that in a degree
that would scarcely be suspected by one who had not ex·

amined them in reference to this subject.
